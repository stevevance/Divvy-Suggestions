Why did I make this?
The original Shareabouts-hosted version of the Chicago bike-share suggestion map, before it was even called Divvy, used a single JSON file to populate markers on the map. 

The new version, launched 12-11-13, uses multiple JSON files, of 50 markers each, and of different types (some markers may represent suggestions while other markers represent existing Divvy stations). 

This website downloads all of the files needed to create one new JSON object and lists all of the suggested Divvy locations by popularity. That is, the number of supporters each suggestion has. 

Who am I?
I am the deputy editor for Streetsblog Chicago, a news site about sustainable transportation and livable streets. I like writing statistical analysis stories, no matter how trivial the information. I make the Chicago Bike Guide, an app for iOS and Android to find Divvy stations, bike routes to anywhere in the region, and more information about using a bicycle in the area, and on public transit, than you might ever need.
